## üñ•Ô∏è Developing

Development processes can all be accomplished through the VSCode UI.

1. Open the "Run and Debug" view in the sidebar. (`SHIFT + CMD + D`)
2. Click the green "play" button at the top (`F5`), with "Run Extension" selected in the dropdown next to it.
3. A new window will open, with the extension loaded for your debugging
    - Select the 'Flagpole' flag icon in the sidebar to activate the extension and load the views
    - Open the `sentry-options-automator` repo to see something in the extension's tree views!

Notice the 'Debug Console' in the host window. Any `console.log` messages from the extension will be printed here. You can also set breakpoints in your code inside TypeScript files like `src/extension.ts` to debug.

The extension will rebuild in the background as you edit files, but the debug window will not reload to show changes.
To reload the debug window with the latest build of the extension run 'Developer: Reload Window' (`CTRL + OPT + CMD + L`) from the command palette.
